# Expo CLI Incompatibility Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using the Expo CLI. The error arises from an incompatibility between the app's dependencies and the currently installed Expo SDK version. 

The `bug.js` file shows example code that might cause the error.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by updating the dependencies or adjusting the code to be compatible with the current Expo SDK.
