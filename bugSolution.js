The solution depends on the specific cause of the incompatibility.  Common solutions include:

1. **Update Expo SDK:** Check the release notes of the libraries you're using to see which Expo SDK version they support. Update your Expo SDK version using `expo upgrade`.

2. **Update dependencies:** Use `expo install` or `npm install` to update outdated libraries.

3. **Use compatible libraries:** If an update is not available, find alternative libraries that are compatible with your current Expo SDK version.

4. **Code adjustments:**  The incompatible library or feature might need to be rewritten or replaced. Review the documentation for your library to ensure compatibility.  Consider whether a newer library or different implementation could address the issue while maintaining functionality.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js - Example of updating the library or removing it
import CompatibleLibrary from 'compatible-library'; // Replace with an updated or compatible library

// ... rest of the code using the compatible library...
```
