This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and attempting to run an app that uses a library or feature not compatible with the current Expo SDK version or environment.  For example, using a library that requires a newer version of React Native or a feature that's been deprecated.

```javascript
// Example code that might produce the error (using an outdated library)
import OutdatedLibrary from 'outdated-library';
```
